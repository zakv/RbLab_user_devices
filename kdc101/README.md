# KDC101

## Introduction

This directory contains the code necessary to use a Thorlabs KDC101 brushed DC servo motor controller.
The KDC101 is capable of controlling various pieces of hardware.
As of this writing, these pieces of hardware are typically controlled by the Z8 series of brushed DC servo motors, such as the Z812.

## Installation

This code depends on Thorlab's Kinesis API.
This is installed when installing the Kinesis software (including GUI) from Thorlabs.
This package uses pythonnet to interact with Thorlab's Kinesis .NET API, so that must be installed as well.
It is installable via pip or conda.
